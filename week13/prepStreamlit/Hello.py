 * Add in a sidebar on our main page to view all pages

 * Reorganize our page into this new format

First, let's rename our `app.py` file to `Hello.py`.

1. `2_Widget_Exploration.py`
1. `3_Altair_Plots.py`
1. `4_Other_Tools.py`
            
**NOTE: The formatting here of the file names is specific!** It determines their order and how they appear on the sidebar.
            
Each page will need to have:
1. A `set_page_config` call, including a title and an icon
1. A message displayed on page selection with a `sidebar.header` call

Once this is done, we can then move the items from our original `app.py` file to each page.
